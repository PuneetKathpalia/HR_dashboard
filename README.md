# HR Performance Dashboard

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a simple HR dashboard I built to help managers keep track of their team's performance. It's built with Next.js and has a clean, modern look thanks to Tailwind CSS.

## What's Inside?

- **Dashboard Home**: See all your team members at a glance
- **Quick Search**: Find people by name, email, or department
- **Bookmarks**: Save profiles you check often
- **Performance Tracking**: Rate and track performance with a simple star system
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes when working late!

3. Run it:
